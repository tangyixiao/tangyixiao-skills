# Cloud Logging Finops

**Non-interactive runs.** When no user can answer (e.g. a scheduled or
automated run), ask nothing: audit the project named in the request, or the
active gcloud project; use `--billing-mode=search`; cover all five report topics
(Step 2.5); and never enable an API or upgrade a log bucket. Put anything that
needed a user (a disabled API, a missing role, the upgrade advisory) in the
report instead.

## Usage Attribution

**MUST READ**: Before executing any `gcloud`, REST API, or MCP command, you
MUST read and follow the instructions in
[Usage Attribution](references/attribution.md).

## Step 0: Locate the Cloud Billing Export

The audit covers one Google Cloud project, `{project_id}`: the project the user
names or, if they don't name one, the active gcloud project (`gcloud config get
project`), confirmed with the user.

Discover everything else (log buckets, Observability Analytics, sinks,
exclusions, metrics) yourself; never ask the user about those. The billing export is the
exception: finding it unaided can mean scanning every project on the billing
account, so ask once, before running anything, and don't start a search until
the user has chosen answer 3 (single-select, using the host's question tool if
it has one):

> **Do you know where the Cloud Billing export for `{project_id}` is?**
>
> 1.  **Yes** — here it is *(the BigQuery table ID `project.dataset.table`, or
>     just the project and dataset)*
> 2.  **There's no billing export** for this project
> 3.  **No / not sure** — search for it *(seconds on a small project; on a large
>     billing account it can take a long time)*

Answer | Flags                                                                                         | Cost figures
------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------
1      | `--billing-mode=explicit` plus `--billing-table` (or `--billing-project`/`--billing-dataset`) | invoiced
2      | `--billing-mode=none`                                                                         | list-price estimates
3      | `--billing-mode=search` *(default)*                                                           | invoiced if found, else estimates

Answer 3's search has no time limit: it checks `{project_id}` first (usually
under 10 s, 1–2 min with many tables), then every project on its billing account
(can take many minutes; progress prints every 30 s). Tell the user this before
launching. If the wait is unacceptable, offer to switch to answer 1 (they look up
the table) or answer 2 (skip the export and use list-price estimates). Don't
suggest setting up an export to make the search faster.

If the search found an export, tell the user: *"Next time, pass
`--billing-table=<table>` and discovery drops to about two seconds."*

## Step 1: Environment Setup

Check these prerequisites before Step 2; fix only what is missing:

*   **gcloud:** if `gcloud` is not installed, follow
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk.md.txt.
*   **Project:** run `gcloud config get project`; if it isn't `{project_id}`
    (from Step 0), run `gcloud config set project {project_id}`.
*   **Credentials:** the scripts use Application Default Credentials. Run
    `gcloud auth application-default login`, or set
    `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a service account key.
*   **Billing:** the project must have an active billing account attached.
*   **APIs:** don't enable APIs up front; the Logging, Monitoring, BigQuery and
    Observability APIs are on by default in new projects. Only if the collector
    reports an API as disabled (`SERVICE_DISABLED`, "has not been used in
    project"), name it, ask the user, and on approval run `gcloud services
    enable {api} --project={project_id}` (tagged as described below):
    *   `logging`, `monitoring`: required; without them there is nothing to
        audit.
    *   `bigquery`: invoiced costs from the billing export.
    *   `observability`: resolves the project's default log scope, so log
        samples match what Logs Explorer shows.
    *   `cloudasset`, `cloudbilling`: only answer 3's search across the billing
        account.

IAM roles for the identity running the audit. The skill never grants roles: the
scripts run with the user's own credentials and read only what those
credentials can. When a step fails on permissions, its advisory names the step;
tell the user which role below it needs:

Role                                                                 | Needed for
-------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------
`roles/logging.viewer`, `roles/monitoring.viewer`                    | Every audit: log buckets, sinks, log samples, volume metrics
`roles/bigquery.jobUser`, `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` (on the export dataset) | Invoiced costs from the billing export
`roles/logging.viewAccessor` on log views in other projects        | Reading samples through a default log scope that includes them
`roles/cloudasset.viewer`, `roles/billing.viewer` (billing account)  | `--billing-mode=search` across the billing account
`roles/logging.configWriter`                                         | Only the optional Observability Analytics upgrade (Step 3B)

```bash
[ -f /tmp/finops_venv/bin/python ] || (uv venv /tmp/finops_venv && uv pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt --python /tmp/finops_venv/bin/python)
```

The bundled scripts tag their Google Cloud API requests. For commands you run
yourself, follow [Usage Attribution](references/attribution.md).

## Step 2: Data Collection

Start the collector below as a background process (it takes from seconds to
many minutes), then go to Step 2.5 while it runs:

```bash
/tmp/finops_venv/bin/python scripts/collect_logging_data.py \
  --project-id {project_id} --billing-mode={none|explicit|search}
```

Optional: `--billing-project`, `--billing-dataset`, `--billing-table` (e.g.
`billing-proj.ds.gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXX` or a curated FinOps view).

Outputs: `logging_usage_summary.json`, `monthly_details/`, `service_details/`,
and `[FINOPS ADVISORY]` lines (see Step 3). The collector's output ends with a
`[COLLECTION PROFILE]` table of per-stage timings; if the run took longer than
the times in Step 0, or the user asks why the audit took so long, read that
table before guessing.

## Step 2.5: Ask What the Report Is For

Always ask this while the collector runs (multi-select). If the user skips it,
cover all five topics:

> **What should this report answer?**
>
> -   Where is the money going — attribution by service and stream
> -   Is spend growing — trends and projection
> -   What can I safely turn off — concrete savings actions
> -   What are these logs actually saying — noisiest patterns and samples
> -   Severity and audit-log posture

The user's choices decide which outputs you read in depth and what your
summary leads with; they never change what the collector gathers:

Interest         | Read deeply
---------------- | -----------
Attribution      | `service_details/*.json`, `daily_services`
Growth           | `monthly_details/*.json`, `mom_patterns`, `cost_projection`
Savings actions  | `reduction_actions`, `extraneous_spend`
What logs say    | `severity_summary.samples_by_service`, `granular_analytics.top_signatures` (Observability Analytics only)
Severity / audit | `severity_summary`, withheld-rule reasons

Your narrative goes in `insights/executive_summary.html` (see
[Executive Summary Authoring](references/executive_summary_authoring.md)).
You don't write the savings actions: the generated report's Cost Optimizer tab
lists them from `reduction_actions`.

> [!CAUTION] Never edit `assets/report_template.html`.

## Step 3: Follow the Advisories

### A. Tell the User What the Cost Figures Are Based On

> [!IMPORTANT] Unless figures are invoiced (`billing_metadata.invoiced`), tell
> the user in plain language where you looked, what you found, and what the
> numbers are based on. Keep internals (stage numbers, mode names, HTTP codes,
> "quota project", "Cloud Asset Inventory") in the log and
> `billing_metadata.fallback_chain`.

*   **Answer 1, the location gave no costs** (`explicit_table` or
    `explicit_scope` step not `found`): the collector never searches beyond what
    the user named. Tell them what was wrong, from the step's `detail` (no rows
    for this project, no export table there, or the query failed), that costs
    are list-price estimates, and offer to rerun with a corrected location or
    with answer 3.
*   **Answer 2** (`user_declared_no_export`): "I didn't search — you told me
    there's no billing export — so costs are list-price estimates, not invoiced
    amounts." Never call a skipped search exhausted.
*   **Answer 3, found nothing** (`billing_account` status `not_found`): "I
    searched this project and your billing account and found no billing export.
    Costs are list-price estimates (quote each SKU's price and free tier from
    `pricing.skus`) over a trailing 30 days." Only this case supports
    recommending export setup. Cite the official pricing page
    (https://cloud.google.com/products/observability/pricing) as the source of
    list prices.
*   **Answer 3, search failed on permissions** (any step status
    `inconclusive`): tell the user the lookup couldn't complete, so costs are
    estimates. Never tell them no billing export exists; the search didn't
    finish.
*   **Answer 3, this project's table rejected** (`local_project` status
    `no_project_records`): "This project has a billing export, but it holds no
    records for this project, so I searched the rest of the billing account."
    Then report the outcome of that wider search as above.
*   **Partial history:** months are labelled `actual_bq_billing` or
    `usage_estimated`; state the exact date boundary in the executive summary.

When on list pricing, recommend export for accuracy: future audits would use the
actual invoice, including discounts, over multiple months.

### B. Observability Analytics

Observability Analytics was formerly called Log Analytics; the scripts'
advisories and field names still use the old name.

*   **Disabled:** present the advisory, including that upgrading the log bucket
    is irreversible, then end your reply with a direct question, e.g. *"Do you
    want me to upgrade the `_Default` log bucket to Observability Analytics?
    This can't be undone."* Telling the user how to run it themselves is not
    asking. Only after they approve upgrading that log bucket, run `/tmp/finops_venv/bin/python
    scripts/enable_log_analytics.py --project-id {project_id}`. The audit
    proceeds on Cloud Monitoring either way.

> [!CAUTION] Never run `enable_log_analytics.py` or `gcloud logging buckets
> update --enable-analytics` in the same turn you raise the advisory, or on
> general permission like "do whatever you need".

*   **< 24 hours old:** the 14-day Cloud Monitoring baseline is used until
    samples accumulate (~1–2 hours).
*   **1–13 days:** cite the sample window in the report.
*   **≥ 14 days:** full SQL analytics.
*   **`Representative logs unavailable` advisory:** samples are missing because
    your environment can't read log entries (needs `roles/logging.viewer`), not
    because streams are empty. Relay the error and role; per-stream detail is in
    `severity_summary.sample_errors`.
*   **Samples empty but the stream has volume:** samples are read through the
    project's default log scope, like Logs Explorer
    (`analytics_metadata.log_read_scope`). If its `source` is `project` and it
    has a `note`, the scope couldn't be resolved, so logs held outside this
    project's log buckets weren't read. Say that and relay the `note`; never say the
    stream has no logs.

### C. Measurement Integrity

> [!CAUTION] Never quote cost or volume derived from Observability Analytics
> payload byte sums; they overstate billed volume about 2x.

Question                     | Source
---------------------------- | ------
Cost, GiB ingested           | Billing export (`billing.query_logging_billing_costs`, `daily_gib`, `monthly_costs`)
Service mix                  | `logging.googleapis.com/billing/bytes_ingested` (`resource_type`)
Log stream / severity volume | `logging.googleapis.com/byte_count` (`log`, `severity`)
Severity mix, entry content  | Observability Analytics SQL (`constants.PAYLOAD_BYTES_SQL`)

*   Totals come from the invoice when it exists; metrics only supply shares.
    Never put a metric-derived total next to an invoiced one.
*   `byte_count` (received) and `billing/bytes_ingested` (billed) differ by
    ~1.5x or more; never divide one by the other.
*   If `telemetry_integrity.status` is `degraded`, say dips on the listed days
    look like a metric defect that won't self-correct, and repeat the limits in
    `telemetry_integrity.note`. Never claim with certainty that nothing changed.
*   A month with `is_partial: true` is month-to-date. Label it so, and never
    call it a complete month or "last month".

### D. Extraneous Spend

`extraneous_spend.headline` is a conservative floor: the sum of the
`reduction_actions.actions` with `counted: true` (duplicate bucket routing,
flow-log sampling, DEBUG logs, stale exclusions), each priced on exactly what
its remedy removes. Everything else is surfaced, never counted: over-retention
(not quantified), sampled exclusion rules (estimates), and Data Access audit
logs (in `withheld`).

1.  Report it as a floor (`≥ X%`), never a point estimate or "up to".
2.  If `status` is `insufficient_data`, give no figure — not a guess, a
    benchmark, or $0.
3.  Quote any action's `flag` verbatim; it is written for the reader.
4.  Uncounted actions and `uncounted_total_pct` may be mentioned as upside,
    never added to the headline.
5.  If `headline.exceeds_sanity_ceiling`, say the headline isn't reliable, name
    the largest counted action, and flag it for manual review. Offer no number.
6.  If `inventory_unavailable` is non-empty, say log sink, exclusion and
    flow-log actions weren't checked; never say none exist.
7.  Whenever Data Access audit logs come up (a `withheld` entry, or the user
    names them), say they are left out of the number because they need a
    compliance decision: disabling or excluding them is frequently prohibited
    by compliance or security policy, so the owner must confirm before acting.

### E. Exclusion Filters and Actions

*   Only Cost Optimizer actions carry filters and savings; Service Details
    volumes are not savings. Report `sample_coverage.shown_pct`.
*   Quote an action's monthly figures (`monthly_gib`, `monthly_usd`), never a
    rule's sample-window GiB (`granular_analytics.exclusion_candidates`).
*   `rule_scope: stream` drops every log entry of that severity in the stream; say so.
*   If `refused_claims` is non-empty, name the streams the safety gate removed.

Never offered as actions: `CRITICAL`/`ALERT`/`EMERGENCY` (incident signal), free
`_Required` streams ($0, audit retention), Data Access audit logs (often
compliance-mandated; report, never count), and streams with no measured volume.

> [!CAUTION] Hand-written exclusion filters must: include a severity predicate
> (`severity = "DEFAULT"` for DEFAULT — omitting it matches everything); use the
> URL-encoded log ID (`compute.googleapis.com%2Ffirewall`); never embed
> unescaped log text or rotating tokens (UUIDs, IPs, long integers, times) in a
> regex; and respect the list above.

## Step 4: Build and Deliver the Report

```bash
/tmp/finops_venv/bin/python scripts/build_report.py --summary logging_usage_summary.json --insights-dir insights/ --output log_usage_report.html
```

`build_report.py` writes an executive summary unless you provide
`insights/executive_summary.html`.

Give the user one link that, when clicked, opens the fully rendered report — not
raw HTML, not a missing file — from wherever the user actually is. Confirm that
will happen before you post it.

Then list what they can explore (charts, service drilldowns, ranked actions with
copyable filters, ✓ Prove It drawers) and suggest 3–4 follow-up questions drawn
from this project's data, phrased to ask as-is.

If the user asked something specific, answer it directly with both GiB and USD,
from `monthly_aggregations` (`latest_complete_month` names the newest whole
month; each month's `top_service` is its Top Cost Driver), `mom_patterns`,
`cost_projection`, `trailing_30d_summary` (its `top_driver` is the report's Top
Cost Driver without an invoice), `granular_analytics` (present only when
Observability Analytics ran), or the per-service/month detail files.

## Step 5: Follow-Up Questions

**Phase 1 (default):** answer from the JSON on disk in a few sentences or a
small table, name what the data can't settle, then stop and offer 3–4 ways to go
deeper. Don't re-run collection or re-query sources.

Question about         | Read
---------------------- | ----
A severity             | `severity_summary`, `granular_analytics.top_signatures` for that severity
A service              | `service_details/{service}.json`, `top_signatures` and `top_log_names` for it
An optimization action | its entry in `reduction_actions.actions` (`claims`, `refused_claims`, `flag`, `counted`)

**Phase 2 (only after the user picks a direction):** go as deep as it needs. Run
Observability Analytics SQL against `analytics_metadata.table_name`, the `_AllLogs` view
the collector measured. Step 3 still applies.

## Step 6: Prove It

`provenance.claims[<id>]` records each headline figure's `formula`, `sources`
(exact query, Google Cloud console link, steps; only the 10 largest streams per action),
known `differences` from the console, and runnable `checks` (covering every
stream). Ids include `latest_complete_spend`, `mtd_run_rate`,
`trailing_30d_volume`, `estimated_run_rate`, `top_cost_driver`,
`extraneous_spend`, `severity_costs`, `service_mix`, `action::<action id>`. A
claim built from others lists them in `see_also` (`extraneous_spend` → its
counted actions); prove those too, and `verify_claim.py` re-checks them with it.

When asked to prove a figure:

1.  **Now, from disk:** walk the formula with its inputs; list each source with
    its Google Cloud console link, its query exactly as recorded, and steps; then the
    `differences`.
2.  **Same turn, in the background:** run `/tmp/finops_venv/bin/python
    scripts/verify_claim.py --summary <summary> --claim "<id>"`; don't wait.
3.  **When it finishes:** a table (check | report | live | Δ | ✓/△/✗) and a
    one-line verdict. Explain △ with the recorded `differences`; give ✗ causes
    in one line each.

> [!CAUTION] Prove It is the only request that may re-query sources, and only
> via `verify_claim.py`. Don't re-run collection or alter the recorded queries.

Disclose when relevant: whether the claim was priced (`pricing.mode`) `per_sku`
(each SKU's price and free tier in `pricing.skus`) or `blended` (reason in
`pricing.notes`); that service and severity figures exclude credits; and, if
`cross_project_billing`, that reproducing it needs `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`
on the billing export dataset and `roles/bigquery.jobUser`.
